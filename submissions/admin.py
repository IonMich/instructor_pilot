# To organize the list page, we need to create a class that inherits from
# ModelAdmin and then register the class with the admin site. Then we can
# customize the list page by adding fields to the list_display attribute.
# the most useful fields are id, assignment, student, attempt
# there are probably too many students, so don't filter by student
